                    <span class="paragraph-info">
                        Hello, my name is Martim Tiburcio and I'm going to share a bit of my story. I have always had a
                        great interest in computers and the digital world, but due to a series of circumstances, I was
                        not able to fully dedicate myself to studies. I had to deal with the responsibility of being a
                        very young father and the need to work hard to support my family. <br><br>

                        Throughout my professional journey, I have accumulated various significant experiences. I began
                        my career in the Brazilian Navy, where I worked for 2 years as responsible for the vessels.
                        Subsequently, I worked in Tinguá public transportation as a fare collector, demonstrating my
                        ability to adapt to new challenges. <br><br>

                        Next, I joined Lojas Americanas S.A, initially as a merchandise separator, and later, I was
                        promoted to a night checker. Additionally, I worked as a food delivery driver on platforms such
                        as iFood, Uber Eats, and Rappi, further enhancing my professional experience. <br><br>

                        I dedicated two years as a mechanical assistant, which provided me with valuable skills to take
                        care of my own vehicle in the future. I also had the opportunity to work for a year in an
                        automotive parts industry, further enriching my professional repertoire. <br><br>

                        Currently, I am at Interlux Electrical Materials, where I have made significant contributions to
                        the company's growth since March 2023. At the same time, I am investing in a career transition,
                        pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Descomplica Faculdade and taking additional
                        courses to enrich my portfolio. <br><br>

                        I am extremely enthusiastic and committed to reaching new horizons in my career. My
                        determination and passion for learning drive me to pursue significant achievements in the field
                        of technology. I appreciate the opportunity to share a bit about who I am, where I am, and where
                        I am determined to go.

                            In this project, I made a request to the Poke API, which significantly contributed to my
                            learning in Promises. This experience provided the opportunity to deepen my knowledge in web
                            development and allowed me to explore the integration of third-party APIs into applications.
                            Furthermore, the project was developed in partnership with Digital Innovation One, under the
                            guidance of professor Renan Johannsen, which added even more value to my learning journey.
                            I'm excited to apply these skills to future projects and continue expanding my knowledge in
